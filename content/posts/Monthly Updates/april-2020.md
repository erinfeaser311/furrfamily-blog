# General Life Update

Ah, April 2020. I'm sure I would have hated it more if quarantine life and new-parent life weren't basically the same thing anyway! :D We have really enjoyed working from home though (and both of us feel very fortunate we have jobs that allow us to do this). It's been a great way to get more time with Selene, even though it's made getting work done during the day difficult.

Selene turned 9 months old on April 16th.

Honestly not much has changed with her--she made so many changes between 6 and 8 months (learned to sit-up, pull herself up, and crawl properly literally within weeks of each other) that she's been pretty content to just be the last month. She has her top 4 teeth coming in (still working on the last one) and now says "mommom" almost as much as "dada". She also says "ok" and "yeah" which is just hilarious. We just love her so much!

We celebrated Easter at both parents, and even though it was a bummer not to get out and enjoy Selene's first Easter at church, I think she still had fun at her grandparents.

So during quarantine we've been doing lots of family walks (weather permitting) and it's just been great to get out and walk around our beautiful neighborhood. Selene LOVES being outside too--she cries like somebody broke her heart when we have to come back inside.

I've been trying lots of new recipes since I have more time to cook and prep things during the day since I'm home. A couple things I've made this month we have really liked--

# Funny Selene Things

Selene took her first picture of herself the other day on my phone! I found it about a week later when I was scrolling through my Photos app.

Selene also answers the phone on her new walker toy thing. It's hilarious.

# Other Family Updates

* Daniel has been studying and prepping all month long for teaching Penn State's parenting preparation courses -- couldn't be more proud of all the work he does both at his regular job and now his new teaching position!
* I got accepted to both Master's degree programs I applied to (UT MS in Computer Science and Georgia Tech MS in Analytics). I am leaning towards the UT program, but have been doing lots of research to make a decision. I am so excited to start back to school in the fall and fulfill this lifelong goal!

That about sums up this not-very-eventful month! Hopefully things turn around soon!
